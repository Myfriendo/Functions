## Functions

This directory contains reusable functions I've created for various purposes. Each function will have a clear explanation of its functionality and usage.

* **function_name1.py** (or relevant file extension)
    - Description: Briefly explain the function's purpose.
    - Usage: Provide an example of how to call and use the function.
 
* **euclideanDistance.py** (or relevant file extension)
    - Description: This function calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in n-dimensional space. The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points.
    - Usage: Provide an example of how to call and use the function.(yet to fill)
    - Resource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance

## Homework

This directory contains completed homework assignments for different programming courses or self-directed learning. Each folder will represent a specific assignment with:

* The problem statement (if applicable)
* Solution code files
* Optional explanations or notes

* **homework_1**
    - Description: Briefly describe the assignment topic or prompt.
    - Files: List the code files for the solution.

## Tries (Experiments)

This directory houses code snippets and experiments I've conducted to explore new concepts, test hypotheses, or practice specific techniques. Each experiment will be documented:

* **try_name.py**
    - Description: Briefly explain the experiment's objective or what you're trying out.
    - Code: Show the code used in the experiment.


## Notes

This directory contains notes I've taken while learning or working on different programming topics.

* **notes.md**
    - Organize your notes by topic or keep a single file for general notes.
